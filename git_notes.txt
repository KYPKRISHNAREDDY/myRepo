git config --global .name ""

git status
git init
git clone
git diff to see the changes made to old file

Working Directory(Temp changes)-> Staging Index(Added) -> Repository(Committed)

git log details about latest to old commits
git log -3  latest 3 commits
git log -p shows diff also(Changes done will be shown)
git log --oneline shows only msgs during committing
git log --stat to show file names which got changed
git show commitId shows changes made in that particular Commit


git add filename to track changes in file
git commit to bring it to repository from staging area


commit head moves to latest commit
git diff to see changes made
git restore file.txt to restore the file to the prev version at head 


to not track some files
create .gitignore file and add *.txt to ignore tracking that file
so Now the change wont be no more visible in git status
you can add filename or path also in that .gitignore file which has to be ignored from tracking


git branch notes 2 for testing feature
